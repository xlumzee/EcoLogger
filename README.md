# Sensory

Micro Weather Sensory app

The main idea is:

Your IoT device (or data source) sends new readings to your backend server and stores them in MongoDB Atlas.
The backend then pushes these new readings to the UI (browser or Streamlit app) using either a WebSocket (e.g., Socket.IO, Django Channels) or Server-Sent Events.
The UI receives these updates automatically and renders them immediately.
